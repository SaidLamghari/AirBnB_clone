# The AirBnB Clone Project
##"""""""description of the project"""""""""""""""
#
The objective of the full-stack software engineering program is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Console using my own server. 
The completed version of this project will include the following features:


1. Command Interpreter: The project includes a command interpreter that allows data manipulation without a visual interface, similar to a shell. This interpreter facilitates development and debugging tasks.

2. Database: The project incorporates a comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities. This database stores and organizes the data needed for the system's operations.


How to Create a Python Package:
- To create a Python package, you can follow these steps:
  1. Organize your code into directories and subdirectories based on functionality or module.
  2. Create an empty file named `__init__.py` in each directory to indicate that it's a package.
  3. Optionally, create a `setup.py` file to define metadata about your package, such as its name, version, dependencies, etc.
  4. Use the `import` statement to import modules and classes from one part of the package to another.


Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
